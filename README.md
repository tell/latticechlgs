Mirrors and scripts for lattice cryptosystems

# Mirrors
A directory `generators` contains source codes of geenrators of the [SVP Challenge](https://www.latticechallenge.org/svp-challenge/) and the [Ideal Lattice Challenge](https://www.latticechallenge.org/ideallattice-challenge/).

# Notices

Generators in the directory `generators` use the pseudo-random number generator implemented by [NTL](http://www.shoup.net/ntl/).
Note that instances provided by the challenges above are generated by NTL version 9.3.0 or older.
Namely, the generators built with newer versions of NTL will output different instances.
