# latticechlgs
Mirrors and scripts for challenges related to the lattice cryptosystems

## Mirrors
A directory `generators` contains source codes of geenrators of the [SVP Challenge](https://www.latticechallenge.org/svp-challenge/) and the [Ideal Lattice Challenge](https://www.latticechallenge.org/ideallattice-challenge/).

## Notices

Generators in the directory `generators` use the pseudo-random number generator implemented by [NTL](http://www.shoup.net/ntl/).
Note that instances provided by the challenges above are generated by NTL versions between 5.5.2 and 9.3.0.
An internal implementation for PRNG of newer versions of NTL has been changed, so that the generators built with them will output different instances.
