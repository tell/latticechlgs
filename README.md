Mirrors and scripts for lattice cryptosystems

# Mirrors
A directory `generators` contains source codes of geenrators of the [SVP Challenge](https://www.latticechallenge.org/svp-challenge/) and the [Ideal Lattice Challenge](https://www.latticechallenge.org/ideallattice-challenge/).

# Notices

Generators in the directory `generators` use an implementation of pseudo-random number generator of [NTL](http://www.shoup.net/ntl/).
Note that its implementation has been changed since a version 9.4.0, so that the generators built with the latest NTL output different instances from archived instances in the challenge Web sites.
